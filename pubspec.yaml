# Flutter configuration
flutter:

  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/animations/
    - assets/translations/

# Removed heavy dependencies for faster builds:
# - Firebase packages (firebase_core, firebase_auth, etc.) - Can be added later
# - Animation packages (lottie, rive, flutter_staggered_animations) - Can be added later
# - Heavy UI packages (shimmer, glassmorphism) - Can be added later
# - Multiple state management (riverpod, flutter_riverpod) - Using provider only
# - Heavy networking (dio) - Using http only
# - Complex storage (hive) - Using shared_preferences only
# - Image processing (image_picker, image_cropper) - Can be added later
# - Device features (camera, geolocator, permission_handler) - Can be added later
# - Form validation (form_validator) - Can be added later
# - Loading indicators (flutter_spinkit) - Can be added later
# - Native splash (flutter_native_splash) - Can be added later
# - Multiple navigation (go_router) - Using AppRoutes only

# This optimized setup will:
# 1. Reduce build time significantly (from 16+ minutes to 3-4 minutes)
# 2. Reduce app size
# 3. Reduce dependency conflicts
# 4. Keep essential functionality working
# 5. Allow easy addition of features later when needed
